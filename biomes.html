      <li>Resources: Normal</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Mountainous worlds contain common resources found on many other types of worlds. They are , not surprisingly, peaked and rich in stone and rock. They are also home to several interesting sub-biomes such as mountain healing springs. By most standards, these worlds are not much harsher than forests and jungles.</p>

      <li>World Type: Ocean</li>
      <li>Threats: Darkwater</li>
      <li>Resources: Coral, Plagueis Nodule</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These oceanic worlds are rockier than their tropical counterparts, and have unique island formations. Some possess deep underwater canyons, volcanic expanses or corrupted isles covered in strange toxic water. You'll find coral of various sorts here, all of which are handy when extracting for resources.</p>

      <li>Threats: Normal</li>
      <li>Resources: Algae, Fossils, Glowing Shrooms</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Fungal worlds are similar to Bog worlds in most respects apart from their native flora. Here, fungus reigns supreme. Otherwise, you'll find essentially the same ores and resources. Fungal worlds appear in most star system types, but tend towards warmer temperatures.</p>

      <li>Threats: High</li>
      <li>Resources: Cinnabar, Prisilite, Trianglium, Crystal, Diamond</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These babies are situated in the cold zone of many stars, and are a strange and impossible mix of heat and cold. Careful of the weather, or you will most certainly die.</p>

      <li>World Type: Terrestrial</li>
      <li>Threats: Average</li>
      <li>Resources: Trianglium, Densinium, Sulphur</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While not inherently deadly, Lightless Sphere biomes are loaded with mystery. They are one of the few places you will find trianglite ore, and they house secrets thought lost to the cosmos. Not much grows here, and you won't get much air. It should also go without saying that you're going to need a light source or be devoured by the dark.</p>

      <li>Threats: Low</li>
      <li>Resources: Prisilite, Sulphur, Crystal, Diamond, Shadow Gas</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Extremely cold, but without all the nasty evil weather present in Ice Wastes, Ice Moons are also the source of a few otherwise rare minerals. You'll want to visit at least one of these bad-boys at some point. Note, however, that their terrain is hazardous. You'll find liquid nitrogen pools, as well as abundant and strange ice formations. Slip the wrong way, and you may find yourself in a nasty tumble. You're going to want a grappling hook, or a Lasher Hook or you'll have a really painful time.</p>
    </div>

      <li>Threats: Low</li>
      <li>Resources: Cinnabar, Prisilite, Trianglium, Crystal, Diamond</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You don't want to be caught on an Ice Waste without ample cold protection. You'll freeze to death in seconds without it. Beware the harsh winds and flying ice blocks, too. They'll rip you apart. Oh also, no air will be found there so you will most certainly need an oxygen supply.</p>
    </div>

<div class="item width50">
  <h1>Sulphuric / Sulphuric Ocean</h1>
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/uo9agda.png">

      <li>Threats: Low</li>
      <li>Resources: Cinnabar, Densinium, Sulphur, Lead, Iron , Coal</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is no harsher place in the universe at present than a Sulphur world. The high winds blow rocks around that can do some serious hurt to you. The pools of boiling hot sulphuric acid aren't incredibly healthy either. A complete lack of air just makes it worse. Nothing lives on sulphur worlds. At least, nothing sane.</p>
    </div>

  <h1>Proto-World</h1>
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZtCyIbN.png">

      <li>Danger Level: <span class="yellow">Moderate</span></li>
      <li>World Type: Terrestrial</li>
      <li>Threats: Average</li>
      <li>Resources: Protocite, Trianglium</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These strange worlds are the product of some sort of alien engineering by unknown progenitors. Large and ugly purple trees dot the landscape, taller and thicker than the usual tree types and provide valuable Protocite. This energy-storing ore can also be found beneath the surface. You'll need some, so get mining or chopping. Do watch out for the ooze storms and the bio-ooze puddles though. They'll slow you down and do some nasty damage. Also, you should probably avoid randomly eating the vibrant cornucopia of bizarre alien plants.</p>

<div class="item width50">
  <h1>Metallic Moon</h1>
  <img src="http://www.mediafire.com/convkey/9dc5/q131audd1sdxc34zg.jpg">

      <li>Danger Level: <span class="yellow">Moderate</span></li>
      <li>World Type: Moon</li>
      <li>Threats: Low</li>
      <li>Resources: Moonstone, Densinium, Helium 3, Shadow Gas</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Apart from a lack of breathable air, Metallic Moons are relatively harmless. They are rich in metal ores, and make clompy sounds when you walk. They only appear as moons. Densinium is most common here of all the biomes. That isn't saying much, since it's exceptionally rare even then.</p>
    </div>

<div class="item width50">
  <h1>Rainforest</h1>

      <li>World Type: Terrestrial</li>
      <li>Threats: Average</li>
      <li>Resources: Algae, Fossils, Petals</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thick jungles are handy places to gather plant fibre, as well as Jungle Dirt and Jungle Soil tiles which extract a higher ratio than standard dirt will. That means more useful resources for you. They tend to have heavy rainfall, and hurricane season can be nasty. Algae and fossils abound.</p>
    </div>

<div class="item width50">
  <h1>Bog</h1>

      <li>World Type: Terrestrial, Ocean</li>
      <li>Threats: Average</li>
      <li>Resources: Algae, Fossils, Swamp Water</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Bogs are somewhat common, appearing in most systems. They are extremely rich in algae (which is fantastic for bio-fuel) and several types of plants found nowhere else. Their soil is moist and easy to mine, making for a rich location for a newcomer to gather resources.</p>

      <li>World Type: Terrestrial</li>
      <li>Threats: Extreme</li>
      <li>Resources: Cinnabar, Densinium, Black Ash, Magma Rock, Burning Magma Rock, Scorching Magma Rock</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Redder, magma-y-er , and burnier. Infernus worlds are hot and deadly. The atmosphere itself tries to kill you, it rains lava and fire AND there are strange creatures wandering around just waiting to murder you. Without good protection , and some sort of hazard suit or immunizing plant you won't last long. They are an excellent source of many minerals, Cinnabar being chief among them.

      <li>Threats: Average</li>
      <li>Resources: Cinnabar, Prisilite, Trianglium, Crystal, Diamond, Purple Crystal (extracts to Silicon)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Crystal Moons are interesting. Freezing cold, but abundant in crystals, they are a guaranteed source of useful materials to anyone looking to create gear. They also typically have pools of organic soup that can provide energy boosts to the intrepid adventurer in danger. Without the crystal composing the ground here, there is no way to craft pure enough Silicon for your purposes. Eventually, you'll have to visit a Crystal Moon if you wish to advance in your crafting. They are also the only place in the universe where Lunari crystal can be found.</p>

      <li>Resources: Prisilite, Moonstone, Penumbrite</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Little sunlight ever touches the surface of these worlds. Note that this does not mean they get <i>no</i> sun. Something in their atmosphere merely reflects the light , but still allows UV through. Thus, you get a comfortable temperature, though a tad humid. Interestingly, plants still grow here. Penumbra worlds are also one of the only places in the universe to find Penumbrite. This resource is essential to creating super-hard alloys required for many of the FrackinUniverse weapons and armor.

    <p>Well, that's depressing. Once, people lived on these worlds. Now, little but mutants and lucky surviving fauna wander the surface. Ash storms are common, and you'll also find many ruins.</p>

      <li>Resources: Bloodstone, Blood, Genetic Material</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ugly trees, questionable puddles of blood/water (who knows!?!?!?) and occasionally deadly weather all combine to make this a weird place to visit. Some were once home to life forms much like us...until their experiments wiped them out, leaving behind only gory grossness. Which explains the trees that #@$#@ing stare at you. Good times.</p>

    </ul>
    <p>Icky and sticky, slime worlds offer up easily broken and extracted slime and little else to those who do not adore disgusting slimy ground slipping them up when they walk. Mild weather, humid temperatures. The stickiness and sliminess of this world will slow you down slightly, and reduce your friction with the ground. Watch your step!</p>

      <li>Resources: Irradium, Uranium, Plutonium, Trianglium</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Well, it should be obvious that these are radioactive. You don't want to be here without the relevant protective filters on your suit. Ordinary radiation protection will not do. You'll need superior protection than that. Plants manage to grow here, and life manages to flourish. So it can't be ALL bad , right? These planets tend to be quite rich in Uranium and are the only place you can find Irradium.</p>

    <p>Huge trees, rich soil and somewhat rainy. Primeval Forest worlds are a great source of wood, and are typically safe places to wander thanks to a lack of deadly weather types. They are rich in algae and fossilized bone for your crafting pleasure. Thick, black tar is also common. Huge beasts can sometimes be seen lumbering their way through these prehistoric woods.</p>

    <p>Atropus worlds are living and dead, all at the same time. Experts disagree on their nature, some saying they are experiments while others insist that they are literal breathing planets. Flesh is the number one export of these worlds, followed by lovely and decorative bone. While they do have rough weather from time to time your biggest worry here is usually being really @#$#@ing grossed out.

    </ul>
    <p>Nitrogen Seas are essentially what they sound like. Cold, icy worlds with a massive ocean buried beneath a solid layer of ice. An ocean made of liquid nitrogen. They have no air, so you'll want oxygen on your person as well as some sort of way to protect against the frigid air.</p>

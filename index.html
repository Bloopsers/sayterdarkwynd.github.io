  <h1>Latest Update 0.394</h1>
    <div class="itemcontent"><img src="images/biome.png" />
      <p>We have a ton of new toys to play with lately in the form of cool new features thanks to the recent liquid interaction update. Now I've taken a break from that stuff to focus on fixing issues and making biomes more interesting in preparation for the Starbound 1.0 release.</p>
      <h2>Bug Fixes & General Changes</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>fixed a typo causing “fuelder” to cause issues on biomes (should have been fuelders)</li>
      <li>fixed a .wav being called instead of of an .ogg on jellyblocks</li>
      <li>updated Tungsten and Durasteel sprites to match Nightly</li>
      <li>Slime Launcher swapped to activeitem type weapon.Primary fire is liquid slime, secondary is its original projectile
      <li>Grav Gun swapped to activeitem type weapon. Primary fire shoots grav rain, secondary shoots original projectile. Also updated grav gun sprite and hand position</li>
      <li>Magma Vulcan is now Pyre Vulcan. It’s projectiles erupt with super-heated iron. Even the little ones</li>
      <li>added Poison, Sulphuric Acid, Healing Water and Bio Ooze squirt guns</li>
      <li>Scorching Deserts got more personality. Many more potential biome variations are now possible there, along with plant spawns and trees different from ordinary deserts</li>
      <li>fixed Gyrusens+ mod compatibility with blueslime</li>
      <li>regeneration blocks (blueslime, proto) have shorter duration and slightly less regen</li>
      <li>adjusted many weather types to be less severe. You’ll see less fog in misty rain, have less intense effects in Slime Storms and greater visibility in Sulphur storms (and more)</li>
      <li>added more liquid interactions with solid tiles</li>
      <li>Quietus Ore got a new look to suit the changes below</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Atropus Improvements:</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>Merged most of Bloodstone stuff into Atropus. I felt little need for two “horror” biomes when one will suffice. Bloodstone as a tile will appear as a sub biome now.</li>
      <li>Quietus and Blood Diamonds are now obtained on Atropus biomes</li>
      <li>Doom Trees now have one extra branch variant</li>
      <li>added new flesh tree</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Bloodstone/ Bloodstone Sea Improvements:</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>Bloodstone Effectively removed, replaced strictly by subbiome</li>
      <li>Bloodstone Sea renamed to Atropus Sea and tiles adjusted to suit</li>
      <li>New orbital horizon graphic for Bloodstone/Atropus Sea</li>
      additional liquid selections for Bloodstone/Atropus Sea</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Fungal Biome Improvements:</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>added new mushroom tree 
      Sidenote: considering merging this into the Bog biome as a sub-biome instead once 1.0 is launched. It serves little point as it’s own biome and at that point I will be able to do some nifty things with biome variety.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Primeval Biome Improvements:</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>Slight adjustments to parallax</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rainforest Biome Improvements:</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>Slight adjustments to parallax</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Desert Waste Biome Improvements:</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>Renamed biome from Desert Wastes to Red Desert in cockpit view</li>
      <li>Fixed planet color scheme</li>
      <li>Fixed non-visible planet mask bug</li>
      <li>Adjusted day/night lighting to contain more red</li>
      <li>Added new weather selections</li>
      <li>Adjusted Plant selections (Quellstem now grows wild there)</li>
      <li>Adjusted Monster spawns</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Sulphuric Biome Improvements:</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>Added new weather type: Acid Rain</li>
      <li>Reduced frequency of the Lesser and Greater sulphuric storms</li>
      <li>Added Severe Sulphuric Storms as a low chance (same as tar rain)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In a nutshell: One of the most ambistious mods for a game called Starbound.</p>
      <p>Formerly "Frackin' Flora", it has been re-branded as Frackin'Universe because the scope is so much larger than I'd initially intended. It is a "catch-all" mod that enhances almost every major area of starbound play in some fashion.</p>
      <p>The primary focus is gene-engineering your own plants, each with their own qualities and uses to make play more interesting. It comes with a large variety of new biomes, sub-biomes, underground biomes, and underground sub-biomes (and new planet core types!) that provide ample exploration opportunities. Some resources can be found only on particular types of worlds and no others so you'll need to be savvy if you want the best lab you can muster.</p>

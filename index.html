        <div class="textbox">

          <p class="whitetext">FrackinUniverse is not a small mod by any means. It is closer to a Total Conversion and extends gameplay in Starbound by approximately 50-200 hours. Expect a learning curve. The following is a general list of features and there is more to offer than listed.</p>

<p class="type legendary">Core Gameplay Changes & Additions</p>
	  <div class="info">
		  <ul class="features">

		    <li>+ Based loosely on real-world science, many resources can be found just as you'd expect in the real world. Extract hydrogen and oxygen from water, use saltpeter to create explosives or condense carbon into diamond</li>
		    <li>+ <strong class="raretext">A re-paced early game</strong>: Don't just rely on copper and iron. You can use bone and leather too, giving you several early-tier branching equipment paths to choose from</li>
		    <li>+ Every play style has access to their favored weapon type within the first tier of play</li>
			<li>+ Well <strong class="raretext">over 100 new status effects</strong> that provide buffs, debuffs and countless other effects on your character</li>
			<li>+ <strong class="raretext">Every backpack now has Augment slots</strong>. This is due to changes to the EPP system (read below)</li>
			<li>+ <strong class="raretext">Liquid Interactions</strong>: Change the composition of tiles or even other liquids using liquid. Turn a dirt hovel into a slimey cave or turn harmless metal into deadly, super-heated steel.<li>
			<li>+ <strong class="raretext">Tile Effects</strong>: Various terrain types will affect your travels. Ice will make you slip, snow will slow you down and mud will stick you good. Some materials even provide beneficial effects. Cover your bases ground in asphalt and run like the wind!</li>
			<li>+ <strong class="raretext">EPP revamp</strong>: Rather than each EPP upgrade protecting against all previous effects, each now protects *only* against its particular type of effect. There are literally dozens of other ways to protect yourself from them in FU.</li>
		    <li>+ <strong class="raretext">over 100 new tile types</strong></li>
		    <li>+ <strong class="raretext">Fear the Dark</strong>: Without a light-source, exploration is extremely unwise</li>
		    <li>+ <strong class="raretext">over 20 new liquids</strong> such as Liquid Nitrogen, Sulphuric Acid, Beer, Honey and Aether</li>
		    <li>+ <strong class="raretext">new physics types</strong> for weapon projectiles</li>
		    <li>+ Various <strong class="raretext">additional weather types</strong>. Sulphur storms, insanity-inducing deluges and gravity-reversing rain are but a few</li>
